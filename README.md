>For Yuyuan Cup.

## Description

This project is our entry for the Yuyuan Cup, which is a important competition in my school. And the project requirements can be find in "大赛要求.pdf".   

&emsp;&emsp;It need to be remote controlled by a controller, which I use PS2 controller to do this. And it can also be auto-controlled by itself to do some specific works.

&emsp;&emsp;All of those are based on STM32.  

## Update Records

2016.09.01  
This is the beginning of the projects. We test on the controller first. And we will keep on, until the project has been finished.   

2016.09.02  
Add movement.c and movement.h, which are used to control the motor of the car.  

2016.09.03  
Fix the problem in movement.c, which may cause the car to go to wrong directions.
