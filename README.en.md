## Description

This project is my entry for the Yuyuan Cup, which is a important competition in my school.    

## Functions
1. Use PS2 to control the car's movement direction;
	
	Since the sticks' Sensitivity are not good, here we use buttons to complete our tasks. But if you like, you can also use sticks. When push them to the limit, they will have the same functions as buttons.

2. Grab things with the mechanical arm;
  
  Here we need to fetch 2 cubes whose side length is 5cm and a ball with a diameter of 5cm.

3. Black line tracking;

4. Detect infrared lamps and touch the swith to turn off them;

5. Adjust the position by itself to climb the slope of 30 degrees.
